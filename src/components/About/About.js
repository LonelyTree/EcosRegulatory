        <p>Over the years, health, safety, security and environmental consulting firms have consolidated into huge entities e.g., CH2M Hill, Tetra Tech Inc., AECOM.  That is not to say that they donâ€™t do good work, however, there is an upward trend for the need of personalized, focused, and affordable HSSE consultants.
        </p>
        <p>Ecos Regulatory Group is a consortium of professional consultants that provide such a service.  Our associates are located throughout the U.S.  We represent all environmental disciplines including water, waste, air, remediation, auditing, etc.

        </p>
        <p>Ecos services can be provided by an individual expert, or a team of consultants, with the requisite experience.  This collaboration of professionals offers the technical expertise of a large firm, with the flexibility and affordability of a small firm.</p>
